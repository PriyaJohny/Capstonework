#Stroke Analysis through Vizualizations
# George Washington Capstonework

In various fields around the world, machine learning is used. There are no exceptions in the healthcare sector. Machine learning has a crucial role in diagnosing conditions including Stroke, high blood pressure, heart disease, and more. If foreseen far in advance, such information can offer intuitions essential to doctors, who can modify their diagnosis and approach per patient.

Visualization has helped people to view, interact with, and better understand data in several meaningful ways. Data visualization is essential for data cleaning, exploring data structure, detecting outliers and unusual groups, and identifying trends and clusters to a great expend. It helps businesses, stakeholders, and gain an enormous amount of knowledge on how they can make the best of their data for the company's growth.

In this project, we conduct an analysis of patients' data and perform machine learning modeling to predict the lifestyle of stroke-affected patients. We further analyze the data to find through research that lifestyles result in about 87%, according to the Centers for disease control and prevention which led to the ischemic dataset analysis.


PURPOSE
The purpose of our project is to analyze lifestyle features with respect to Stroke using a dataset obtained through medical examinations in hospitals. According to earlier research, the variability of stroke is a substantial and independent risk factor for many other diseases. We further analyze the ischemic stroke dataset to classify hospitals as better, as expected, or worse with respect to hospitals in California.


DATASET
Dataset I: In this case study is from Kaggle named as “Stroke Prediction dataset” and contains medical information of patients. The dataset contains 5110 patient records and 11 features. We are using “Stroke” as our target variable. It is a Binary class classification problem, where the value of the class is 0 and 1 (0 means the patient will not have a stroke and 1 means the patient will have a stroke). Dataset is imbalanced and consists of 10 attributes other than the target attribute.
Dataset II: In this case study is from California Health and Human Services Agency named “Ischemic Stroke 30-Day Mortality and 30-Day Readmission Rates and Quality Ratings for CA Hospitals”. The dataset contains risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission rates, quality ratings, and the number of deaths or readmissions and cases for ischemic stroke patients that are treated in California hospitals, but does not include ischemic stroke treated in outpatient settings.
